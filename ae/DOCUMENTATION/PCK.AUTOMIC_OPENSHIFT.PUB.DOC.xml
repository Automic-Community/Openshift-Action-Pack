================================
OpenShift is a platform as a service (PaaS) from Red Hat that is built on Docker and Kubernetes. Kubernetes is an open source, container as a service (CaaS) project originating from Google.

The core of the platform is containers and orchestration. For the container side of the house, the platform uses images based on the docker image format. For the orchestration side, it uses Kubernetes.
